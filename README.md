CAPSTONE IDEAS

1. Life/ BucketList Planner - places you want to go and do use google earth data/ OpenStreetMap maybe

It compiles a list of long and short term goals and accumulates a life completion calculator. New goals are accepted 

- Gathers data about user at first which can be updated
- Life expectancy and income are incorporated for time tables (itâ€™s a lifelong goal program)
- Short term goals will narrow location
- Using APIs from EVENTBRITE, GOOGLE MAPS/EARTH, OPENSTREETMAP
- Categorizes goals based on travel, time, social, dependence of other tasks
- Works like an RPG QUESTLINE

2. FACEBOOK CLONE FOR CAR ENTHUSIASTS
- You can create a profile of your car and see how it compares to others
- Arrange races or car shows, see suggestions from others on modifications
- Share pictures and stats of your car

3. DARE DEVIL HEAVEN/ FREER SPIRIT?
- Social platform for dares that accumulate points
- From simple things you can do in your home to places you need to sign up for, dares will be worth points you can accumulate
- Tiers of dareDevil can be achieved based on points held globally 
- Dare groups can be created to set challenges between friends
- Proof must be sent and verified by moderators or a sufficient number of users
